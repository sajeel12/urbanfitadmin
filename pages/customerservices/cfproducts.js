                    We will endeavour to respond as quickly as possible, however, if you require a prompt response, you may contact us at 800 â€“ 000000 (800000000) from 9:00 - 21:00 GST<br /><br />
                    Unfortunately, like many iconic brands, our designs are targeted by criminals who are producing and selling counterfeit products intended to deceive consumers and profit from our success. Several reports have highlighted that the major profits that can be made from selling counterfeit products are used to fund terrorism and organized crime. Furthermore, there is often a terrible human cost as counterfeiting is often associated with child labor and modern slavery.<br /><br />
                    In order to fight this illegal trade in counterfeit products and protect consumers, we have established a dedicated Brand Protection Team consisting of lawyers, investigators and anti-counterfeiting specialists who are responsible for combatting the production, supply and sale of counterfeit Urban Fits products in specific countries. Our team works closely with customs and law enforcement agencies to disrupt and eliminate the sale of counterfeit products both online and in markets in over 10 countries.

                <p>
                    On a daily basis we are reporting websites, social media pages and online marketplace accounts that are offering counterfeit UrbanFits products. We recognize it can be difficult to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit product, especially online. Therefore, always be cautious of buying any Urban Fits product from websites that offer substantial discounts and avoid any products claiming to be factory seconds or overruns.<br />
                    Based on our experience we have identified several characteristics of websites that are offering counterfeit product or will fail to deliver the product you ordered:<br />
                    A. The website will often have little to no contact information such as company names, physical or email addresses and telephone numbers.<br />
                    B. The website will not protect your personal data and credit card information and will not feature HTTPS:// or show a small padlock symbol next to the website address (URL).<br />
                    C. The website will sometimes mirror an official Urban Fits website even-though the domain name may not relate to the brand.<br />
                    Please note that purchasing products from unauthorized retailers is always at your own risk. You will find genuine Urban Fits product at UrbanFits.AE, UrbanFits stores or authorized UrbanFits retailers.
