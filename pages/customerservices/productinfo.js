                    2-year warranty<br />
                    Urban Fits luggage is rigorously tested to ensure that the travel products you trust meet stringent standards. Consequently, if a problem occurs with Urban Fits luggage (the "Product") and the problem is caused by manufacturing defects in material and workmanship, Urban Fits will, in its discretion, either fix or replace the Product in accordance with the warranty terms and conditions stated herein. The warranty provided for herein applies only if you provide original receipt of purchase. Your statutory rights in case of a defect items remain unaffected by this warranty.<br />
                    This warranty covers only manufacturing defects and does not cover any damage caused by misuse (such as transportation of unusual items), neglect, accidents, abrasion, exposure to extreme temperatures, solvents, acids, water, normal wear and tear or transport damage (e.g. by airlines).<br />
                    If you wish to exercise your rights under this warranty, please contact the local Customer Service for further instructions (e.g. on where to send the Product to) by sending an e-mail to: support@urbanfits.ae<br />

                    Our Customer Service team will explain you in detail how and where to send damaged luggage to us. You are responsible for all costs of getting the Product to us, including, but not limited to, the cost of packaging, shipping and applicable taxes.
                    For warranty service you will need the original receipt of purchase. The Customer Service team will determine whether or not the problem is covered by Urban Fit's warranty. If the warranty applies, you will be notified as to whether the Product will be repaired or replaced. Any such repair or replacement will be at Urban Fit's expense, including any costs required to return the repaired or replacement product to you. If the Product is to be replaced and the Product is no longer available, Urban Fits will substitute a comparable Urban Fits product.<br />

Labor charges and damages attributable to work performed by anyone other than Urban Fit's Customer Service (and our third party service providers if applicable) are not covered by this warranty. The warranty provided herein is limited to the value of the Product. Manufacturing specifications are subject to change without notice. Product locks are intended only to prevent accidental opening and cannot necessarily prevent theft of the Product or its contents, breakage or entry by airline or airport personnel or authorities.
